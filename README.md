# Welcome to Movie Night


## Description

If you're as indecisive as me, finding a movie to watch can take longer than actually watching the movie! That's why I created movie night. When you land on the home page, you start by setting a couple of filters. Movie Night will then display a random movie for you that meets all of your filters! If you are interested in the movie but want to save it for a later time, you'll be able to add it to a watchlist
